Photopea is a website aims to bring near-Photoshop experience to low-level users. It has a UI(User interface) that mimics the one of Photoshop. It could be used for editing images and graphical design.

To use Photopea, simply go to its website [photopea.com](https://www.photopea.com/) this basically downloads a small, lightweight version of Photoshop onto your browser and runs it on your browser. Depend on your network, it may take some time to load the website.

You can also install it as a web app. Web apps allow you to open websites as if they are local apps. It is the exact same as opening it on a browser, but you don't see the sometimes annoying browser tabs.

Once you load it, it has a welcome page, which allows you to choose a photo from you computer, or various cloud drives. **Note that since everything is running on your local computer, no photos of your own will be uploaded.**

Similar to `.doc` extension name for word document, or `.pptx` extension for powerpoints, photoshop files uses `.psd` as extension. Photopea also supports other forms of documents, but generally `.psd` files are the most widely supported.
